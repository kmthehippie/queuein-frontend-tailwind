## 🛡️ Introduction

Welcome to **queuein**, a queue management application designed for small businesses such as cafés, clinics, and restaurants.  
queuein is currently in its **alpha testing phase**, meaning it is under active development and may experience bugs, errors, or service interruptions.

By using queuein, you agree to the following **Privacy Policy** and **Terms & Conditions** (“Policies”).  
These documents are intended to protect both you (the user) and us (the developer) while promoting transparency and compliance with the **Malaysian Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA)**.

If you do not agree with these terms, please stop using the service.

# 🧾 Privacy Policy (Alpha Version)

## 1. Introduction

We value your trust and are committed to protecting your personal data.  
This Privacy Policy explains how queuein collects, uses, and protects information in compliance with the PDPA and its upcoming amendments.

queuein is developed and operated by an independent developer based in Malaysia.  
Because this is an **alpha version**, certain features — including data export, deletion requests, or automated notifications — may still be under development. Please use at your own risk.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

Depending on how you use queuein, we may collect:

### a. Business Information

- Business name and email (encrypted)
- Outlet details (name, location, phone number)
- Staff names, roles, and login credentials (hashed passwords or OAuth tokens)

### b. Customer Information

- Customer names and phone numbers (encrypted)
- Queue details (pax, position, timestamps)
- Customers may optionally choose to mark themselves as VIPs. (Optional)
  This preference only affects retention duration and does not replace the PDPA-required consent for data collection.

### c. Technical Information

- Browser and device details (for login tracking)
- Logs for debugging and performance improvement
- Audit trails for staff activity

We collect only the minimum data necessary to operate and improve the service.

---

## 3. How We Use the Information

Data is used for:

- Managing and displaying business queues
- Allowing businesses to recall returning customers (if opted in)
- Sending notifications or status updates
- Detecting and preventing misuse
- Improving product functionality and user experience

We **do not sell or trade personal data** to any third parties.

---

## 4. Data Storage and Protection

We apply reasonable technical and organisational safeguards:

- Sensitive data is encrypted in our database
- HTTPS is enforced for all communications
- Database access is restricted to authorised systems only
- Backups are made regularly and securely
- Non-essential or test data may be periodically purged

However, because this is an **alpha version**, **we cannot guarantee absolute security or continuous uptime**.  
By using queuein during this phase, you acknowledge and accept this limitation.

---

## 5. Cross-Border Data Transfers

queuein is currently hosted on **Render.com**, which may store data in regions such as **Singapore** or the **United States**.  
We take reasonable measures to ensure data stored outside Malaysia receives protection consistent with PDPA standards.  
You will be notified if we migrate to Malaysian-based hosting in the future.

---

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your business and queue data for as long as your account remains active.  
Inactive or test data may be deleted after **6–12 months** of inactivity.  
You can request deletion by emailing **km_dev@hotmail.com**.

---

## 7. Your Rights Under PDPA

You have the right to:

- Access and correct personal data we hold about you
- Withdraw consent for data processing
- Request deletion of your account or data
- Withdrawal does not affect data that was processed prior to the withdrawal.

To make a request, contact **km_dev@hotmail.com**.

---

## 8. Data Breach Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. We will investigate and contain the issue promptly
2. Notify affected users as soon as practicable
3. Take corrective steps to prevent recurrence

As an alpha-stage product, queuein’s breach response is manually managed.
